### IBUYPOWER Snowblind Background
This software runs in the background. It will automatically detect your snowblind screen (Granted its your only display running at 1280x1024), and then draw a white background over the entire display. 

It should attempt to always stay on bottom, so that it acts more like a wallpaper rather than a normal application.

Very low impact. Will boot on startup, uses 0 CPU and 3MB of RAM.
